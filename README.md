### Terrain Detection App README

This README provides an overview of the Terrain Detection App implemented in Python using Tkinter, Folium, OpenCV, and YOLOv5 for satellite image prediction.

#### Overview
The Terrain Detection App allows users to input latitude and longitude coordinates and then detects terrain types at those coordinates using satellite imagery. It utilizes Folium to generate a satellite map, YOLOv5 for object detection, and OpenCV for image processing and display.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- Folium
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- OpenCV
- ultralytics (YOLOv5)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
- pip install folium opencv-python-headless pillow tkinter ultralytics


#### Running the App
1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a Python file.
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the Python script.

#### How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the latitude and longitude coordinates in the respective entry fields.
3. Click the "Get Coordinates" button to set the coordinates.
4. Click the "Detect Terrain" button to detect terrain types at the specified coordinates.
5. The app will display the predicted terrain on the satellite image.

#### Files
- `terrain_detection_app.py`: Contains the main code for the Terrain Detection App.
- `weights.pt`: Pre-trained YOLOv8 weights file (not included in this snippet).

#### Important Notes
- Ensure internet connectivity for accessing satellite imagery.
- The accuracy of the terrain detection may vary based on the quality of the satellite imagery and the performance of the YOLOv5 model.
- You may need to adjust the zoom level in the `generate_satellite_image` method for better visualization.
- Custom YOLOv5 weights can be used by replacing `weights.pt` with the desired weights file path.

#### Credits
- This app was created by integrating various libraries and tools available in the Python ecosystem.
- YOLOv8 is developed by Ultralytics
