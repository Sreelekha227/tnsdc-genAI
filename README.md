# Text to Image Synthesis Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks

## Intoduction

This model is implemented using PyTorch. In this model we train a conditional generative adversarial network, conditioned on text captions, to generate images that correspond to the captions. The network architecture is shown below. This architecture is based on DCGAN.

## Datasets

We used the hdf5 format of these datasets which can be found here for [birds_hdf5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNhn6MYpBb-JwE86GC1kk0VJsYj-Pn5j/view) and here for [flowers_hdf5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EgnaTrlHGaqK5CCgHKLclZMT_AMSTyh8/view). These hdf5 datasets were converted from [Caltech-UCSD Birds 200](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html) and [Oxford Flowers](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/) datasets.

We used the [text embeddings](https://github.com/reedscot/icml2016) provided by the paper([1]) authors. 


## Requirements

- PyTorch 
- h5py
- EasyDict
- PIL
- Numpy

This implementation only supports running with GPUs.<br/>


## Training


**Inputs to the model for training/prediction:**
- `dataset`: Dataset to use `(birds | flowers)`
- `split` : An integer indicating which split to use `(0 : train | 1: valid | 2: test)`.
- `save_path` : Path for saving the models and results
- `pre_trained_disc` : Discriminator pre-tranined model path used for intializing training or continuing from a checkpoint.
- `pre_trained_gen` Generator pre-tranined model path used for intializing training or continuing from a checkpoint.
- `cls`: Boolean flag to indicate whether to train with cls algorithms or not.


## Results

**Here are a few examples of the images generated by our model:** <br/>
